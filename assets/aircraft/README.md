## Su-30 inspired low-poly fighter

- File: `su30.glb`.
- Author: **Lunar Courier project**.
- License: **CC0 1.0** — https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
- Original simplified geometry: twin engines, twin fins, swept wings, canards, tandem canopy and separate landing gear. No externally downloaded fighter mesh is included.
- Rebuild with Node 22+: `node scripts/build-su30.mjs` from the repository root. The script uses the project's pinned Three.js dependency and exports a self-contained GLB.

## Original fictional aircraft fleet

- Files: `t6.glb`, `b62.glb`, `c24.glb`, `d9.glb`, `p72.glb`, `f26.glb`.

- T-6: low-wing single-propeller trainer with a bubble canopy.
- B-62: twin rear-engine business jet with winglets and a high tailplane.
- C-24: high-wing twin-turboprop transport with a rear cargo ramp.
- D-9: single-engine delta-wing fighter with canards.
- P-72: regional high-wing twin turboprop with a T-tail, cabin doors and six-blade animated propellers.
- F-26: twin-engine fighter with clipped wings, canted twin fins and separate intakes and exhausts.
- Original fictional designs; these identifiers do not represent certified real-world aircraft. No external meshes or textures are used.
- Rebuild with Node 22+: `node scripts/build-aircraft-fleet.mjs`. Static geometry is batched by material; landing gear and propeller groups remain separate for runtime animation. Combined GLB size is approximately 444 kB. Rebuild only the new pair with `node scripts/build-aircraft-fleet.mjs p72 f26`.

## Original passenger airliners

- Files: `r220.glb`, `w350.glb`, approximately 250 kB combined.
- Author: **Lunar Courier project**. License: **CC0 1.0** — https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
- R-220: fictional narrow-body twinjet with underwing turbofans, raised wing tips and twin-axle main gear.
- W-350: fictional wide-body twinjet with longer swept wings, curved tips and triple-axle main gear.
- Both include segmented windshields, cabin windows, doors, engine fan blades and independent landing gear. Static meshes are batched by material. No external meshes, textures or real-world aircraft data are used.
- Rebuild with Node 22+: `node scripts/build-airliners.mjs`.

In-game aircraft dimensions, performance, cockpit systems and flight assistance are tuned for gameplay.
